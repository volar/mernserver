# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was created from mongodb example from https://www.mongodb.com/languages/mern-stack-tutorial

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:
### `node server.js`

# Notes

Had to change couple of things during the tutorial 
- init git in the server directory
- there is ommited file called config.env which you will need to add the line
### ATLAS_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@sandbox.<your code here>.mongodb.net/myFirstDatabase?retryWrites=true&w=majorityPORT=5000
